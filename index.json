The week will highlight all aspects of such approaches from data processing and feature engineering to Monte Carlo estimation procedures as well as the most recent theoretical guarantees obtained in high dimensional settings or frameworks with dependent and/or missing data.\nThe scientific program of this week includes 2 mini courses, 6 plenary talks, 15 contributed talks and a practical session.\n","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1567641600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/","section":"authors","summary":"The design and analysis of robust Bayesian methods for high dimensional statistical settings is at the cornerstone of modern real world learning problems.

You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() Math Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math.
